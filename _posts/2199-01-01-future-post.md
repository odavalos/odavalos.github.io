This will be a post about my experience using the tidyverse package [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org) for webscraping pdfs from the [Nature Collection: Statistics for Biologists](https://www.nature.com/collections/qghhqm/pointsofsignificance).

This was the first time using this package and also webscraping in general so if you have feedback on how to make the code better or more efficient please let me know!
